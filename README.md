This is a starter template for Next.js with the following set up:

- TypeScript (v4.9)
- Tailwind CSS (v3.2) & sensible global defaults
- ESLint & Prettier (plugins: typescript-eslint, jsx-a11y)
- pnpm
- lint-staged

I use it to bootstrap my Next.js apps and it will likely evolve with time.

## Getting Started

To use the template with `create-next-app`, run the following:

```
npx create-next-app <project-name> -e https://github.com/nurou/next-ts-tailwind-starter --use-pnpm
```

You can also clone the repo and run:

```bash
pnpm i
```

followed by:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

which will start the devserver at `http://localhost:3000`.
